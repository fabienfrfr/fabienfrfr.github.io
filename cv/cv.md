## Profile

After gaining experience in electronics at Enedis and Vinci, I obtained a PhD in physics, using computer vision techniques. Following my doctoral studies, I developed a new optimization algorithm for artificial intelligence applications. Arriving at Capgemini, I led the iPowertrain research project at Capgemini Engineering. The project aims to develop innovative solutions to optimize the design and energy management of vehicles, where I also worked on reinforcement learning and generative models (NLP-LLM). Today, I am Lead Data Scientist at Thales, where I designed the architecture of a recommendation module based on constrained optimization and time series and implemented the solution.
