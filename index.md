## Welcome to My GitHub Pages

I am a complex systems physicist with a particular interest in interdisciplinary projects. I am interested in artificial intelligence, evo-devo and education. You can see my artistic work on Instagram blog ([@fabienfrfr](https://www.instagram.com/fabienfrfr/)) and a prototype of neural game in Itch.io [@fabienfrfr](https://fabienfrfr.itch.io/).

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/fabienfrfr/fabienfrfr.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/fabienfrfr/fabienfrfr.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
