	abstract = {The article proposes a short term scenario analysis concerning the possible relations between automation, education, and unemployment. According to the author, the scenario analysis elaborated by the McKinsey Global Institute in 2013 underestimates the problem of technological unemployment and proposes an education model which is inadequate to face the challenges of 21st century disruptive technologies. New technological advances—as the automation of knowledge work—will also affect the jobs of highly educated workers. Therefore, policy makers will not avert the scenario of massive unemployment only by extending the study of math, science, and engineering. A better solution could be the establishment of a universal basic income, and the elaboration of an education model capable of stimulating creativity and the sense of belonging to a community.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis assessed the behavioral impact of and psychological processes associated with presenting words connected to an action or a goal representation. The average and distribution of 352 effect sizes (analyzed using fixed-effects and random-effects models) was obtained from 133 studies (84 reports) in which word primes were incidentally presented to participants, with a nonopposite control group, before measuring a behavioral dependent variable. Findings revealed a small behavioral priming effect (dFE = 0.332, dRE = 0.352), which was robust across methodological procedures and only minimally biased by the publication of positive (vs. negative) results. Theory testing analyses indicated that more valued behavior or goal concepts (e.g., associated with important outcomes or values) were associated with stronger priming effects than were less valued behaviors. Furthermore, there was some evidence of persistence of goal effects over time. These results support the notion that goal activation contributes over and above perception-behavior in explaining priming effects. In summary, theorizing about the role of value and satisfaction in goal activation pointed to stronger effects of a behavior or goal concept on overt action. There was no evidence that expectancy (ease of achieving the goal) moderated priming effects. (PsycINFO Database Record},

En admettant alors que tous les instruments découlent les uns des autres par le biais de ces trois chemins de conception, nous avons cherché à produire une méthode de conception fondant concomitamment, et autour d’un même modèle-objet, une capacité d’identification ex post des instruments innovants et une capacité ex ante d’innovation.Au terme d’une démarche de recherche-intervention, nous avons convenu de définir les instruments comme autant de chaînes de causalité préfigurées de l’action collective, et avons formulé un langage algorithmique autour d’un certain nombre d’éléments - des acteurs, des actions, des événements, des opérateurs logiques et des vecteurs d’impact – afin de les caractériser de façon ostensive. En consacrant une méthode d’évaluation de la nouveauté et de l’effectivité instrumentales, nous avons dès lors pu établir qu’un instrument est innovant s’il constitue une nouvelle chaîne de causalité opérant effectivement dans la réalité technico-sociale. De façon corollaire, innover un instrument revient alors à dessiner une nouvelle chaîne de causalité, ou à modifier les acteurs et les actions qui la composent.Afin d’illustrer et d’éprouver cette méthode de conception que nous qualifions de combinatoire, nous avons enfin cherché à interroger le caractère innovant du dispositif des certificats d’économie (CEE) et ce, en proposant un protocole d'évaluation et en formulant diverses pistes d'innovation.},

	abstract = {The meaning of pragmatism is discussed. The pragmatic method is primarily a method of settling metaphysical disputes that otherwise might be interminable. This method tries to interpret such notions as determinism versus freedom and materialism versus spiritualism by tracing their practical consequences. What difference would it practically make to any one if this notion rather than that notion were true? If no practical difference whatever can be traced, then the alternatives mean practically the same thing, and all dispute is idle. The history of the method and its character and affinities are discussed, as well as how it contrasts with rationalism and intellectualism. The word pragmatism has come to be used in a wider sense, as meaning also a certain theory of truth. In this sense, pragmatism is equivalent to humanism, which views truth as giving human satisfaction in marrying previous parts of experience with newer parts. As a mediator between empiricism and rationalism, pragmatism has no prejudices, no obstructive dogmas, and no rigid canons of what shall count as proof. Rationalism sticks to logic and the empyrean. Empiricism sticks to the external senses. Pragmatism is willing to take anything, to follow either logic or the senses and to count the humblest and most personal experiences. Its only test of probable truth is what fits every part of life best and combines with the collectivity of experience's demands, nothing being omitted.

	abstract = {Truth is one of the central subjects in philosophy. It is also one ofthe largest. Truth has been a topic of discussion in its own right forthousands of years. Moreover, a huge variety of issues in philosophyrelate to truth, either by relying on theses about truth, or implyingtheses about truth., It would be impossible to survey all there is to say about truth inany coherent way. Instead, this essay will concentrate on the mainthemes in the study of truth in the contemporary philosophicalliterature. It will attempt to survey the key problems and theories ofcurrent interest, and show how they relate to one-another. A number ofother entries investigate many of these topics in greater depth.Generally, discussion of the principal arguments is left to them. Thegoal of this essay is only to provide an overview of the currentTheories. Many of the papers mentioned in this essay can be found inthe anthologies edited by Blackburn and Simmons (1999) and Lynch(2001b). There are a number of book-length surveys of the topicsdiscussed here, including Burgess and Burgess (2011), Kirkham (1992),and Künne (2003). Also, a number of the topics discussed here,and many further ones, are surveyed at more length in papers inGlanzberg (2018)., The problem of truth is in a way easy to state: what truths are, andwhat (if anything) makes them true. But this simple statement masks agreat deal of controversy. Whether there is a metaphysical problem oftruth at all, and if there is, what kind of theory might address it,are all standing issues in the theory of truth. We will see a numberof distinct ways of answering these questions.},

	abstract = {Objectives The objective of this study has been to confirm the sex and the affinity of an individual buried in a well-furnished warrior grave (Bj 581) in the Viking Age town of Birka, Sweden. Previously, based on the material and historical records, the male sex has been associated with the gender of the warrior and such was the case with Bj 581. An earlier osteological classification of the individual as female was considered controversial in a historical and archaeological context. A genomic confirmation of the biological sex of the individual was considered necessary to solve the issue. Materials and methods Genome-wide sequence data was generated in order to confirm the biological sex, to support skeletal integrity, and to investigate the genetic relationship of the individual to ancient individuals as well as modern-day groups. Additionally, a strontium isotope analysis was conducted to highlight the mobility of the individual. Results The genomic results revealed the lack of a Y-chromosome and thus a female biological sex, and the mtDNA analyses support a single-individual origin of sampled elements. The genetic affinity is close to present-day North Europeans, and within Sweden to the southern and south-central region. Nevertheless, the Sr values are not conclusive as to whether she was of local or nonlocal origin. Discussion The identification of a female Viking warrior provides a unique insight into the Viking society, social constructions, and exceptions to the norm in the Viking time-period. The results call for caution against generalizations regarding social orders in past societies.},

	abstract = {Testosterone plays an important role in mammalian brain development. In neural regions with appropriate receptors testosterone, or its metabolites, influences patterns of cell death and survival, neural connectivity and neurochemical characterization. Consequently, testosterone exposure during critical periods of early development produces permanent behavioural changes. In humans, affected behaviours include childhood play behaviour, sexual orientation, core gender identity and other characteristics that show sex differences (i.e. differ on average between males and females). These influences have been demonstrated primarily in individuals who experienced marked prenatal hormone abnormalities and associated ambiguities of genital development (e.g. congenital adrenal hyperplasia). However, there is also evidence that testosterone works within the normal range to make some individuals within each sex more sex-typical than others. The size of testosterone-related influences, and perhaps even their existence, varies from one sex-typed characteristic to another. For instance: prenatal exposure to high levels of testosterone has a substantial influence on sex-typical play behaviour, including sex-typed toy preferences, whereas influences on core gender identify and sexual orientation are less dramatic. In addition: there appears to be little or no influence of prenatal testosterone on mental rotations ability, although mental rotations ability shows a marked sex difference. These findings have implications for basic understanding of the role of testosterone in normative gender development, as well as for the clinical management of individuals with disorders of sex development (formerly called intersex syndromes).},

	abstract = {Background The problem of anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) abuse has recently generated widespread public and media attention. Most AAS abusers, however, are not elite athletes like those portrayed in the media, and many are not competitive athletes at all. This larger but less visible population of ordinary AAS users began to emerge in about 1980. The senior members of this population are now entering middle age; they represent the leading wave of a new type of aging former substance abusers, with specific medical and psychiatric risks. Methods We reviewed the evolving literature on long-term psychiatric and medical consequences of AAS abuse. Results Long-term use of supraphysiologic doses of AAS may cause irreversible cardiovascular toxicity, especially atherosclerotic effects and cardiomyopathy. In other organ systems, evidence of persistent toxicity is more modest, and interestingly, there is little evidence for an increased risk of prostate cancer. High concentrations of AAS, comparable to those likely sustained by many AAS abusers, produce apoptotic effects on various cell types, including neuronal cells—raising the specter of possibly irreversible neuropsychiatric toxicity. Finally, AAS abuse appears to be associated with a range of potentially prolonged psychiatric effects, including dependence syndromes, mood syndromes, and progression to other forms of substance abuse. However, the prevalence and severity of these various effects remains poorly understood. Conclusions As the first large wave of former AAS users now moves into middle age, it will be important to obtain more systematic data on the long-term psychiatric and medical consequences of this form of substance abuse.},

As female sex hormone concentrations change during the menstrual cycle, oxytocin might fluctuate, too. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated endogenous oxytocin concentrations across menstrual cycle phases in healthy women. Data from 13 studies (120 women) showed a significant increase of oxytocin concentrations from the early follicular phase to ovulation (g = 0.39 [0.25; 0.53], p {\textbackslash}textless .001) and a significant decrease from ovulation to the mid-luteal phase (g = −0.50 [−0.81; −0.18], p {\textbackslash}textless .001). There were no significant differences between the early follicular and mid-luteal phase (g = −0.19 [−0.70; −0.32], p = .471). These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of differences in normal and abnormal psychobiological processes in women.

We report the first meta-analysis of typical sex differences on global brain volume, a descriptive account of the breakdown of studies of each compartmental volume by six age categories, and whole-brain voxel-wise meta-analyses on brain volume and density. Gaussian-process regression coordinate-based meta-analysis was used to examine sex differences in voxel-based regional volume and density. On average, males have larger total brain volumes than females. Examination of the breakdown of studies providing total volumes by age categories indicated a bias towards the 18–59 year-old category. Regional sex differences in volume and tissue density include the amygdala, hippocampus and insula, areas known to be implicated in sex-biased neuropsychiatric conditions. Together, these results suggest candidate regions for investigating the asymmetric effect that sex has on the developing brain, and for understanding sex-biased neurological and psychiatric conditions.},

Ces auteurs ont mis en évidence le fait que le système redistributif français est complexe, peu flexible, inefficace, au total assez faiblement redistributif et fortement biaisé à l’encontre des revenus du travail par rapport à ceux de l’épargne. Nous montrons comment le concept d’allocation universelle, conjugué à une imposition proportionnelle des revenus (flat tax), une taxe uniforme sur les patrimoines et un volet de prestations compassionnelles, permet de définir un ensemble redistributif présentant des caractéristiques opposées.La complexité laisse la place à une allocation universelle versée à tous les résidents en situation régulière, dont le montant varie uniquement selon l’âge, 340 euros mensuels pour les adultes, 192 euros pour les mineurs (montants calculés pour l’année 2010, indexés sur l’évolution du PIB), financée par le prélèvement de 18 \% de l’ensemble des revenus. Une taxe sur l’actif net (1 \% sur tous les patrimoines nets de dettes) remplace l’ensemble de la fiscalité du patrimoine et de sa transmission. Nous utilisons et adaptons l’outil de microsimulation développé par LANDAIS, PIKETTY, SAEZ (2011) pour comparer les effets redistributifs du système actuel à ceux de notre proposition, avec un niveau de précision inédit pour ce type de proposition. Au total, les caractéristiques redistributives analysées par déciles, centiles et milliles de revenus sont proches, les principales divergences ouvrant à une discussion sur l’équité du système actuel, plus particulièrement relativement à la fiscalité pesant sur le travail et les patrimoines les plus élevés.},

	abstract = {Social networking sites (SNSs), such as Facebook, provide abundant social comparison opportunities. Given the widespread use of SNSs, the purpose of the present set of studies was to examine the impact of chronic and temporary exposure to social media-based social comparison information on self-esteem. Using a correlational approach, Study 1 examined whether frequent Facebook use is associated with lower trait self-esteem. Indeed, the results showed that participants who used Facebook most often had poorer trait self-esteem, and this was mediated by greater exposure to upward social comparisons on social media. Using an experimental approach, Study 2 examined the impact of temporary exposure to social media profiles on state self-esteem and relative self-evaluations. The results revealed that participants’ state self-esteem and relative self-evaluations were lower when the target person’s profile contained upward comparison information (e.g., a high activity social network, healthy habits) than when the target person’s profile contained downward comparison information (e.g., a low activity social network, unhealthy habits). Results are discussed in terms of extant research and their implications for the role of social media in well-being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Wealth–income ratios, inherited wealth, and wealth inequalities were high in the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries up until World War I, then sharply dropped during the twentieth century following World War shocks, and have been rising again in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. We discuss the models that can account for these facts. We show that over a wide range of models, the long-run magnitude and concentration of wealth and inheritance are an increasing function of r¯−g where r¯ is the net-of-tax rate of return on wealth and g is the economy's growth rate. This suggests that current trends toward rising wealth–income ratios and wealth inequality might continue during the twenty-first century, both because of the slowdown of population and productivity growth, and because of rising international competition to attract capital.},

Unlike frequentist statistics, which attaches repeated-sampling frequencies to test statistics, Bayesian statistics directly describes uncertainty about unknown statistical parameters with a probability distribution. With this foundation, much of Bayesian statistics follows from basic rules of probability theory. Three areas of Bayesian statistics are especially relevant for sociologists. First, hierarchical regression models allow several levels of uncertainty into an analysis. Second, Bayes factors provide a useful approach to the problems of model selection, model averaging, and posterior inference about model indexes. Third, recent breakthroughs in estimation methods offer valuable new tools for analysis of Bayesian models that were previously intractable.},

Unfortunately, most of the existing works ignore that the spreading probability is not a constant, but depends on the number of spreaders currently. That is to say, the more spreaders, the larger spreading probability. In order to overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose a novel susceptible–infected–removed (SIR) rumor spreading model with the influence mechanism, called SIR-IM, which first incorporates the number of current spreaders into the spreading probability. Then, it employs time function to describe the rate of people from spreader to stifler as time goes on. Moreover, we not only derive mean-field equations to describe the dynamics of our SIR model, but also give theoretical analysis. Numerical simulations are conducted on social networks, which show that the influence mechanism can accelerate the rumor spreading.},

People, however, rarely have global knowledge of the states of others, but must estimate them from the local observations of their social contacts. Network structure can significantly distort individual’s local observations. Under some conditions, a state that is globally rare in a network may be dramatically over-represented in the local neighborhoods of many individuals. This effect, which we call the “majority illusion,” leads individuals to systematically overestimate the prevalence of that state, which may accelerate the spread of social contagions. We develop a statistical model that quantifies this effect and validate it with measurements in synthetic and real-world networks. We show that the illusion is exacerbated in networks with a heterogeneous degree distribution and disassortative structure.},

The first is the case of mutual learning between members of an organization and an organizational code. The second is the case of learning and competitive advantage in competition for primacy. The paper develops an argument that adaptive processes, by refining exploitation more rapidly than exploration, are likely to become effective in the short run but self-destructive in the long run.

Unlike most species, we are able to learn by imitation, and this faculty is at the basis of human culture. In this review we present data on a neurophysiological mechanism—the mirror-neuron mechanism—that appears to play a fundamental role in both action understanding and imitation. We describe first the functional properties of mirror neurons in monkeys. We review next the characteristics of the mirror-neuron system in humans. We stress, in particular, those properties specific to the human mirror-neuron system that might explain the human capacity to learn by imitation.

But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

These groups turn together in unison and produce escape waves. However, it is not clear how escape waves are created from local interactions, nor is it understood how these patterns are shaped by natural selection. By startling schools of fish with a simulated attack in an experimental arena, we demonstrate that changes in the direction and speed by a small percentage of individuals that detect the danger initiate an escape wave. This escape wave consists of a densely packed band of individuals that causes other school members to change direction. In the majority of cases, this wave passes through the entire group. We use a simulation model to demonstrate that this mechanism can, through local interactions alone, produce arbitrarily large escape waves. In the model, when we set the group density to that seen in real fish schools, we find that the risk to the members at the edge of the group is roughly equal to the risk of those within the group. Our experiments and modelling results provide a plausible explanation for how escape waves propagate in nature without centralized control.},

	abstract = {The spontaneous organization of collective activities in animal groups and societies has attracted a considerable amount of attention over the last decade. This kind of coordination often permits group-living species to achieve collective tasks that are far beyond single individuals' capabilities. In particular, a key benefit lies in the integration of partial knowledge of the environment at the collective level. In this contribution, we discuss various self-organization phenomena in animal swarms and human crowds from the point of view of information exchange among individuals. In particular, we provide a general description of collective dynamics across species and introduce a classification of these dynamics not only with respect to the way information is transferred among individuals but also with regard to the knowledge processing at the collective level. Finally, we highlight the fact that the individual’s ability to learn from past experiences can have a feedback effect on the collective dynamics, as experienced with the development of behavioral conventions in pedestrian crowds.},

	abstract = {The population explosion that followed the Neolithic revolution was initially explained by improved health experiences for agriculturalists. However, empirical studies of societies shifting subsistence from foraging to primary food production have found evidence for deteriorating health from an increase in infectious and dental disease and a rise in nutritional deficiencies. In Paleopathology at the Origins of Agriculture (Cohen and Armelagos, 1984), this trend towards declining health was observed for 19 of 21 societies undergoing the agricultural transformation. The counterintuitive increase in nutritional diseases resulted from seasonal hunger, reliance on single crops deficient in essential nutrients, crop blights, social inequalities, and trade. In this study, we examined the evidence of stature reduction in studies since 1984 to evaluate if the trend towards decreased health after agricultural transitions remains. The trend towards a decrease in adult height and a general reduction of overall health during times of subsistence change remains valid, with the majority of studies finding stature to decline as the reliance on agriculture increased. The impact of agriculture, accompanied by increasing population density and a rise in infectious disease, was observed to decrease stature in populations from across the entire globe and regardless of the temporal period during which agriculture was adopted, including Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, South America, and North America.},

Our investigation suggests that some methodological frameworks are available in the literature, but none is perfect. A new development in the field lies in spectral analysis methods for measuring business cycles, which may have advantages over existing methodologies (nonlinearity, stationarity issues). We feel that fractional integration is important in the proper monitoring and explanation of business cycles. Spectral analysis techniques have also proved to be useful for addressing the problems of stationarity and structural breaks in time series when analyzing business cycles. Another important issue that is excluded when studying business cycles is that the link between cycles and economic growth is presumed to be non-existent, implying money neutrality.},

C. S.

He next focuses on patricians he finds particularly fascinating: Lord Curzon, an unrivalled ceremonial impresario and inventor of traditions; Lord Strickland, part English landowner and part Mediterranean nobleman, who was both an imperial proconsul and prime minister of Malta; and Winston Churchill, whom Cannadine sees as an aristocratic adventurer, a man who was burdened by, more than he benefitted from, his family connections and patrician attitudes. Cannadine then moves from individuals to aristocratic dynasties. He reconstructs the extraordinary financial history of the dukes of Devonshire, narrates the story of the Cozens-Hardys, a Norfolk family who played a remarkably varied part in the life of their county, and offers a controversial reappraisal of the forebears, lives, work, and personalities of Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West - a portrait, notes Cannadine, of more than a marriage.Written with sympathy and irony, devoid of snobbery or nostalgia, and handsomely illustrated, Cannadine\&\#39;s book is sure both to enlighten and delight.},

	abstract = {'This book flips your world upside down. Daniel Markovits argues that meritocracy isn't a virtuous, efficient system that rewards the best and brightest. Instead it rewards middle-class families who can afford huge investments in their children's education ... Frightening, eye-opening stuff' The Times, Books of the Year Even in the midst of runaway economic inequality and dangerous social division, it remains an axiom of modern life that meritocracy reigns supreme and promises to open opportunity to all. The idea that reward should follow ability and effort is so entrenched in our psyche that, even as society divides itself at almost every turn, all sides can be heard repeating meritocratic notions. Meritocracy cuts to the heart of who we think we are.But what if, both up and down the social ladder, meritocracy is a sham? Today, meritocracy has become exactly what it was conceived to resist: a mechanism for the concentration and dynastic transmission of wealth and privilege across generations. Upward mobility has become a fantasy, and the embattled middle classes are now more likely to sink into the working poor than to rise into the professional elite. At the same time, meritocracy now ensnares even those who manage to claw their way to the top, requiring rich adults to work with crushing intensity, exploiting their expensive educations in order to extract a return. All this is not the result of deviations or retreats from meritocracy but rather stems directly from meritocracy's successes.This is the radical argument that The Meritocracy Trap prosecutes with rare force, comprehensive research, and devastating persuasion. Daniel Markovits, a law professor trained in philosophy and economics, is better placed than most to puncture one of the dominant ideas of our age. Having spent his life at elite universities, he knows from the inside the corrosive system we are trapped within, as well as how we can take the first steps towards a world that might afford us both prosperity and dignity.},

With close attention to the wide range of knowledge that informs Levi-Strauss's work, Marcel Henaff has written an authoritative and accessible analysis of Levi-Strauss's research in anthropological theory and practice as well as his contributions to the debates surrounding linguistics, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.The book begins with a clear explication of the concept of structure, both demonstrating the relevance and defining the limits of the structural approach to the social sciences. Henaff's focus, like that of his subject, is social anthropology. Within this field, he gives painstaking attention to three areas that distinguish Levi-Strauss's work: kinship systems, systems of classification, and mythologies. His discussion moves from broad questions such as "What differentiates 'historical' societies from those called primitive?" to particular ones, such as "What does Levi-Strauss mean by symbolism? totemism? wild thought?"From these topics, Henaff goes on to consider general philosophical issues concerning the theoretical status of anthropology and the cultural status of the anthropologist. In light of Levi-Strauss's work, he looks at ideas about the universality of the human mind and logical categories, the representation of time in oral cultures and their relation to history, and the responsibility of Western societies to now-vanishing oral cultures. An extensive chronology and detailedbibliography present a valuable overview of Levi-Strauss's career.As debates surrounding structuralism subside, and as anthropology continues to transform itself, this book at last affords a broad and balanced account of the remarkable accomplishments of one of the great intellectual innovators of the twentieth century.},

	abstract = {There is substantial evidence that the human language capacity (LC) is a species-specific biological property, essentially unique to humans, invariant among human groups, and dissociated from other cognitive systems. Each language, an instantiation of LC, consists of a generative procedure that yields a discrete infinity of hierarchically structured expressions with semantic interpretations, hence a kind of “language of thought” (LOT), along with an operation of externalization (EXT) to some sensory-motor system, typically sound. There is mounting evidence that generation of LOT observes language-independent principles of computational efficiency and is based on the simplest computational operations, and that EXT is an ancillary process not entering into the core semantic properties of LOT and is the primary locus of the apparent complexity, diversity, and mutability of language. These conclusions are not surprising, since the internal system is acquired virtually without evidence in fundamental respects, and EXT relates it to sensory-motor systems that are unrelated to it. Even such properties as the linear order of words appear to be reflexes of the sensory motor system, not available to generation of LOT. The limited evidence from the evolutionary record lends support to these conclusions, suggesting that LC emerged with Homo sapiens or not long after, and has not evolved since human groups dispersed.},

	abstract = {Violin design has been in flux since the production of the first instruments in 16th century Italy. Numerous innovations have improved the acoustical properties and playability of violins. Yet, other attributes of the violin affect its performance less, and with fewer constraints, are potentially more sensitive to historical vagaries unrelated to quality. Although the coarse shape of violins is integral to their design, details of the body outline can vary without significantly compromising sound quality. What can violin shapes tell us about their makers and history, including the degree that luthiers have influenced each other and the evolution of complex morphologies over time? Here, I provide an analysis of morphological evolution in the violin family, sampling the body shapes of over 9,000 instruments over 400 years of history. Specific shape attributes, which discriminate instruments produced by different luthiers, strongly correlate with historical time. Linear discriminant analysis reveals luthiers who likely copied the outlines of their instruments from others, which historical accounts corroborate. Clustering of averaged violin shapes places luthiers into four major groups, demonstrating a handful of discrete shapes predominate in most instruments. Violin shapes originating from multi-generational luthier families tend to cluster together, and familial origin is a significant explanatory factor of violin shape. Together, the analysis of four centuries of violin shapes demonstrates not only the influence of history and time leading to the modern violin, but widespread imitation and the transmission of design by human relatedness.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic variance results from variation in biological information possessed by individuals. Quantitative geneticists often strive to partition out all environmental variance to measure heritability. Behavioral biologists and ecologists however, require methods to integrate genetic and environmental components of inherited phenotypic variance in order to estimate the evolutionary potential of traits, which encompasses any form of information that is inherited. To help develop this integration, we build on the tools of quantitative genetics and offer the concept of ‘inclusive heritability’ which identifies and unifies the various mechanisms of information transmission across generations. A controversial component of non-genetic information is animal culture, which is the part of phenotypic variance inherited through social learning. Culture has the unique property of being transmitted horizontally and obliquely, as well as vertically. Accounting for cultural variation would allow us to examine a broader range of evolutionary mechanisms. Culture may, for instance, produce behavioral isolating mechanisms leading to speciation. To advance the study of animal culture, we offer a definition of culture that is rooted in quantitative genetics. We also offer four testable criteria to determine whether a trait is culturally inherited. These criteria may constitute a conceptual tool to study animal culture. We briefly discuss methods to partition out cultural variance. Several authors have recently called for ‘modernizing the modern synthesis’ by including non-genetic factors such as epigenetics and phenotypic plasticity in order to more fully explain phenotypic evolution. Here, we further propose to broaden the concept of inheritance by incorporating the cultural component of behavior. Applying the concept of inclusive heritability may advance the integration of multiple forms of inheritance into the study of evolution.},

Jeremy Holmes traces the evolution of Bowlby’s work from a focus on delinquency, material deprivation and his dissatisfaction with psychoanalysis's imperviousness to empirical science to the emergence of attachment theory as a psychological model in its own right. This new edition traces the explosion of interest, research and new theories generated by Bowlby’s followers, including Mary Main’s discovery of Disorganised Attachment and development of the Adult Attachment Interview, Mikulincer and Shaver’s explorations of attachment in adults and the key contributions of Fonagy, Bateman and Target. The book also examines advances in the biology and neuroscience of attachment. Thoroughly accessible yet academically rigorous, and written by a leading figure in the field, John Bowlby and Attachment Theory is still the perfect introduction to attachment for students of psychology, psychiatry, counselling, social work and nursing.},

Overall, males showed higher avoidance and lower anxiety than females, with substantial between-study heterogeneity. Sex differences were much larger in community samples (bivariate D = .28) than in college samples (D = .12); web-based studies showed the smallest sex differences (D = .07) in the opposite direction. Sex differences also varied across geographic regions (overall Ds = .10 to .34). Sex differences in anxiety peaked in young adulthood, whereas those in avoidance increased through the life course. The relevance of these findings for evolutionary models of romantic attachment is discussed, and possible factors leading to underestimation of sex differences are reviewed.},

	abstract = {Considerable research has examined human mate preferences across cultures, finding universal sex differences in preferences for attractiveness and resources as well as sources of systematic cultural variation. Two competing perspectives—an evolutionary psychological perspective and a biosocial role perspective—offer alternative explanations for these findings. However, the original data on which each perspective relies are decades old, and the literature is fraught with conflicting methods, analyses, results, and conclusions. Using a new 45-country sample (N = 14,399), we attempted to replicate classic studies and test both the evolutionary and biosocial role perspectives. Support for universal sex differences in preferences remains robust: Men, more than women, prefer attractive, young mates, and women, more than men, prefer older mates with financial prospects. Cross-culturally, both sexes have mates closer to their own ages as gender equality increases. Beyond age of partner, neither pathogen prevalence nor gender equality robustly predicted sex differences or preferences across countries.},

	abstract = {Marked geographic patterns for the distribution of some heritable traits are observed in humans, including traits related to disease risk, pathogen resistance and drug response. In some cases, the geographic patterns may be due to natural selection, as shown by correlations between traits and environmental variables (for example, correlations between skin pigmentation and latitude).Spatial patterns of adaptive genetic variation are informative about selective processes. For example, during the spread of an advantageous allele, one can transiently observe 'wave of advance' patterns, or if spatial selection pressures vary across space, stable correlations of allele frequency with environmental variables may be generated.Spatial patterns of neutral variation are also influenced by demographic history. Because some of these genome-wide features may resemble signals of selection, it is important to incorporate information on background spatial patterns of variation when assessing the evidence for adaptations.The extent of allele frequency differentiation across populations can be summarized by the FST statistic. The excess of highly differentiated alleles seen in humans has been interpreted as an effect of positive selection driving diversification between populations.High FST values may also be due to background selection. Because background selection is likely to act more strongly in genic then in non-genic regions, negative rather than positive selection could account for part or all of the observed excess of high FST for genic relative to non-genic SNPs.If selection is strong, targets of local adaptations are expected to have extreme levels of differentiation relative to neutral loci. Accordingly, several variants that confer locally advantageous phenotypes exhibit unusually high levels of allele frequency differences across populations.In natural populations of many species, several quantitative traits are distributed clinally, which mirrors the selective pressures acting on the phenotypes. This observation is consistent with the idea that adaptive genetic variants are also correlated with geographic or environmental variables.Clines of allele frequencies with latitude have been observed for several hypertension susceptibility variants. Moreover, polymorphisms in candidate genes for metabolic syndrome were found to be correlated with climate variables, which is consistent with the hypothesis that spatial patterns of variation are influenced by selective pressures related to thermal stress.Spatial population structure seems to limit the spread of advantageous alleles in humans. Therefore novel mutations and/or standing variation may be more important sources of adaptive variation at a continental scale than the arrival of adaptive alleles through dispersal.},

They have called these two processes specific evolution and general evolution respectively and from these two perspectives on cultural evolution they have developed the Law of Cultural Dominance. Certain operational problems exist in the application of the concept of cultural evolution, but once they have been surmounted it promises to constitute a valuable mode of explanation in the analysis of cultures and cultural change.},

There was little literature within the discipline on which that revolution could be based, and a book with that title could have been seminal.

A parsimonious set of 24 physical geography attributes explains 47\% of worldwide variation and 35\% of within-country variation in lights. We divide geographic characteristics into two groups, those primarily important for agriculture and those primarily important for trade, and confront a puzzle. In examining within-country variation in lights, among countries that developed early, agricultural variables incrementally explain over 6 times as much variation in lights as do trade variables, while among late developing countries the ratio is only about 1.5, even though the latter group is far more dependent on agriculture. Correspondingly, the marginal effects of agricultural variables as a group on lights are larger in absolute value, and those for trade smaller, for early developers than for late developers. We show that this apparent puzzle is explained by persistence and the differential timing of technological shocks in the two sets of countries. For early developers, structural transformation due to rising agricultural productivity began when transport costs were still high, so cities were localized in agricultural regions. When transport costs fell, these agglomerations persisted. In late-developing countries, transport costs fell before structural transformation. To exploit urban scale economies, manufacturing agglomerated in relatively few, often coastal, locations. Consistent with this explanation, countries that developed earlier are more spatially equal in their distribution of education and economic activity than late developers.},

Our findings show that dark triad traits are substantially intercorrelated, somewhat more prevalent among men than women, predominantly related to the Big Five personality factor of agreeableness and the HEXACO factor of honesty-humility, and generally associated with various types of negative psychosocial outcomes. We question whether dark triad traits are sufficiently distinct and argue that the way they are currently measured is too simple to capture the malevolent sides of personality. Because most research in this domain is cross-sectional and based on self-reports, we recommend using a cross-informant approach and prospective, longitudinal research designs for studying the predictive value of dark triad features.},

In each of the experiments the subjects were instructed to estimate the “true” attitude of a target person after having either read or listened to a speech by him expressing opinions on a controversial topic. Independent variables included position of speech (pro, anti, or equivocal), choice of position vs. assignment of position, and reference group of target person. The major hypothesis (which was confirmed with varying strength in all three experiments) was that choice would make a greater difference when there was a low prior probability of someone taking the position expressed in the speech. Other findings of interest were: (1) a tendency to attribute attitude in line with behavior, even in no-choice conditions; (2) increased inter-individual variability in conditions where low probability opinions were expressed in a constraining context; (3) that this variability was partly a function of the subjects' own attitudes on the issue; (4) that equivocation in no-choice conditions leads to the attribution that the equivocator opposes the assigned position. The main conclusion suggested is that perceivers do take account of prior probabilities and situational constraints when attributing private attitude, but perhaps do not weight these factors as heavily as would be expected by a rational analysis.},

	abstract = {Much of politics is involved with the distribution of resources and the regulation of intergroup relations. Social dominance theory posits that social ideologies provide social justification for policies that have unequal effects on different social groups. In the present studies, we examine the mediating role that ideologies have in transforming people's general orientation toward group inequality into policy support. Using data from 5 samples, we offer evidence that social dominance orientation orients people to support discriminatory ideologies, which in turn influence support for policies. Support for the theoretical model was shown in studies of both long-standing social policy attitudes, such as toward social welfare and military programs, and of unfolding political events, including Clarence Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court, the Persian Gulf War, and reinstitution of the death penalty in California.},

Indeed, the ‘social identity approach’ has become one of the most widely used perspectives in contemporary social psychology. In this article, I examine the popularity of Tajfel’s writings on social identity and intergroup relations, especially over the last thirty years when they started to become more generally used. I offer a critical appraisal of the original SIT, both as a theory of intergroup relations and as a theory of identity, concluding that its real value lies in its success in offering an over-arching perspective on the importance of groups in social life and its ability to stimulate new areas of research. I then widen the discussion to consider how the social identity perspective has been used in a number of other fields of enquiry.},

However, progress is often hindered by poor communication between scientists, with different people using the same term to mean different things, or different terms to mean the same thing. This can obscure what is biologically important, and what is not. The potential for such semantic confusion is greatest with interdisciplinary research. Our aim here is to address issues of semantic confusion that have arisen with research on the problem of cooperation. In particular, we: (i) discuss confusion over the terms kin selection, mutualism, mutual benefit, cooperation, altruism, reciprocal altruism, weak altruism, altruistic punishment, strong reciprocity, group selection and direct fitness; (ii) emphasize the need to distinguish between proximate (mechanism) and ultimate (survival value) explanations of behaviours.

	abstract = {Presently, the Wikipedia project lodges the largest collaborative community ever known in the history of mankind. Due to the large number of contributors, along with the amazing popularity level of Wikipedia in the Web, it has soon become a topic of interest for researchers of many academic disciplines. However, in spite of the increasing significance of Wikipedia in scholar publications over the past years, we oftenly find studies concentrating either on very specific aspects of the project, or else, on a specific language version. As a result, there is a need of broadening the scope of previous research works to present a more complete picture of the Wikipedia project, its community of contributors and the evolution of this project over time. This doctoral thesis offers a quantitative analysis of the top ten language editions of Wikipedia, from different perspectives. The main goal has been to trace the evolution in time of key descriptive and organizational parameters of Wikipedia and its community of authors. The analysis is focused on logged authors (those editors who created a personal account to participate in the project). The comparative study encompasses general evolution parameters, a detailed analysis of the inner social structure and stratification of the Wikipedia community of logged authors, a study of the inequality level of contributions (among authors and articles), a demographic study of the Wikipedia community and some basic metrics to analyze the quality of Wikipedia articles and the trustworthiness level of individual authors. This work concludes with the study of the influence of the main findings presented in this thesis for the future sustainability of Wikipedia in the following years. The analysis of the inequality level of contributions over time, and the evolution of additional key features identified in this thesis, reveals an untenable trend towards progressive increase of the effort spent by the most active authors, as time passes by. This trend may eventually cause that these authors will reach their upper limit in the number of revisions they can perform each month, thus starting a decreasing trend in the number of monthly revisions, and an overall recession of the content creation and reviewing process in Wikipedia. As far as we know, this is the first research work implementing a comparative analysis, from an quantitative point of view, of the top ten language editions of Wikipedia, presenting complementary results from different research perspectives. Therefore, we expect that this contribution will help the scientific community to enhance their understanding of the rich, complex and fascinating working mechanisms and behavioral patterns of the Wikipedia project and its community of authors. Likewise, we hope that WikiXRay will facilitate the hard task of developing empirical analyses on any language version of the encyclopaedia, boosting in this way the number of comparative studies like this one in many other scientific disciplines.},

Starting from the basic view that homicides are aggravated assaults with the outcome of the victim’s death, we assembled evidence from national data sources to show that the principal explanation of the downward trend in lethality involves parallel developments in medical technology and related medical support services that have suppressed the homicide rate compared to what it would be had such progress not been made. We argue that research into the causes and deterability of homicide would benefit from a “lethality perspective” that focuses on serious assaults, only a small proportion of which end in death.},

A behavioural study of reactions to windfall payments, in which children received toys and chimps food, reveals a tendency for children as young as three to share windfalls more fairly if they were earned by a team member through a collaborative effort. This contradicts the common assumption that egalitarian tendencies emerge during the school years, at six or seven, when children learn social norms of equality. Chimps do not favour equity, whether or not windfalls were received through collaboration. The modern human tendency to distribute resources more equitably among the larger group may have roots in the sharing of spoils after joint efforts.},

People usually divide money equally for the sake of fairness, and prefer to suffer financial losses rather than accept unfair divisions, contradicting the predictions of orthodox game theory. Models aimed at accounting for the evolution of such irrational preferences have put forward a great variety of explanations: biological, cultural, learning-based, human-specific (or not), etc. This diversity reflects the current absence of consensus in the scientific community, and possibly even an absence of debate. Here, we review 36 theoretical models of the evolution of human fairness published in the last 30 years, and identify six families into which they can all be broadly classified. We point out connections between the different families, and instantiate five of the mainstream models in the form of agent-based simulations for purposes of comparison. We identify a variety of theoretical, terminological, and conceptual problems that currently undermine progress in the field. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, and in particular the modeling of the evolution of fairness in a wider and more realistic range of situations.},

The theory of “morality-as-cooperation” argues that morality consists of a collection of biological and cultural solutions to the problems of cooperation recurrent in human social life. Morality-as-cooperation draws on the theory of non-zero-sum games to identify distinct problems of cooperation and their solutions, and it predicts that specific forms of cooperative behavior—including helping kin, helping your group, reciprocating, being brave, deferring to superiors, dividing disputed resources, and respecting prior possession—will be considered morally good wherever they arise, in all cultures. To test these predictions, we investigate the moral valence of these seven cooperative behaviors in the ethnographic records of 60 societies. We find that the moral valence of these behaviors is uniformly positive, and the majority of these cooperative morals are observed in the majority of cultures, with equal frequency across all regions of the world. We conclude that these seven cooperative behaviors are plausible candidates for universal moral rules, and that morality-as-cooperation could provide the unified theory of morality that anthropology has hitherto lacked.},

The uniqueness of pervasive sharing among humans, especially among unrelated individuals, has led researchers to evaluate numerous hypotheses about the adaptive functions and patterns of sharing in different ecologies. This article attempts to organize available cross-cultural evidence pertaining to several contentious evolutionary models: kin selection, reciprocal altruism, tolerated scrounging, and costly signaling. Debates about the relevance of these models focus primarily on the extent to which individuals exert control over the distribution of foods they acquire, and the extent to which donors receive food or other fitness-enhancing benefits in return for shares given away. Each model can explain some of the variance in sharing patterns within groups, and so generalizations that ignore or deny the importance of any one model may be misleading. Careful multivariate analyses and cross-cultural comparisons of food transfer patterns are therefore necessary tools for assessing aspects of the sexual division of labor, human life history evolution, and the evolution of the family. This article also introduces a framework for better understanding variation in sharing behavior across small-scale traditional societies. I discuss the importance of resource ecology and the degree of coordination in acquisition activities as a key feature that influences sharing behavior.},

Here, we report 2 experiments with 3- and 4-year-old children (N = 195) that contradict this constructivist account. Our results demonstrate that children as young as 3 years old are able to take merit into account by distributing tokens according to individual contributions but that this ability may be hidden by a preference for equality.

	abstract = {In 2007, a study carried out by Hamlin, Wynn, and Bloom provided concrete evidence that infants as young as 6 months were capable of social evaluation, displaying an early preference for agents performing a prosocial behavior. Since then the development of early social abilities to judge other’s behavior has been the topic of a growing body of research. The present paper reviews studies conducted between 2007 and 2015 that experimentally examined infants’ social evaluation abilities by testing their preference for agents acting prosocially. We performed a detailed analysis of a corpus of 16 research studies including 59 experimental results, scrutinizing their methods and findings, and identifying their convergent and divergent features. This analysis showed that a preference for agents who perform prosocial behaviors (as opposed to antisocial or neutral) was present in a majority of infants, but some conflicting results have also been reported. The rich interpretation that infants are endowed with mature socio-moral evaluation abilities has not really been sufficiently discussed. In order to deepen this debate, we assessed other studies that have further explored infants’ understanding of the social value of behaviors. Many of the studies provide evidence that young infants manage to identify and prefer the prosocial agent by taking into account the context and agents' mental states beyond the behavior itself. In this study two specific areas are assessed: (1) studies that have previously explored social evaluation abilities beyond a basic preference for prosocial behavior and (2) current theories which attempt to explain how and why such preferences could exist so early in infancy. Future directions for research on social evaluation abilities in infants are also discussed as well as a review of the literature.},

	abstract = {We argue that emotion cannot only be conceived of as a short-lived and intrapersonal phenomenon. Rather, based on five theoretical arguments, we propose that the social sharing of an emotional experience forms an integral part of the emotional processes. A series of six studies investigated different aspects of this hypothesis. Study 1 showed that an overwhelming majority of people reported sharing their emotional experiences and that the memories of these experiences tended to come back spontaneously to their consciousness. No difference was found among emotions. Using a different procedure, Studies 2 and 3 replicated these findings in two different populations. In addition, these studies provided indications that women share their experiences with a wider array of individuals than do men. The first three studies did not find any differences among emotions, but they did not include shame. It could be argued that people are less inclined to socially share shame experiences which are typically elicited by breaking social rules. Study 4 specifically investigated this hypothesis. No differences among shame and other emotions were found except for the delay of the first sharing of the experience. Study 5 constituted a first investigation of whether the social sharing of emotion is also a significant process in now Western cultures. A comparison between Dutch and Surinamese people failed to reveal any significant difference. Based on the findings of the first five studies, a correlational model was designed in Study 6. It tested the interrelationships among disruptiveness of the emotion, social sharing, mental rumination, and recovery from the emotion disruption. A coherent pattern of findings emerged, showing that social sharing can be conceived as a bi-dimensional concept defined by features of amount and delay of sharing. In addition, both social sharing and mental rumination varied according to the disruptiveness of the emotion. Surprisingly, however, recovery could not be related to social sharing, mental rumination, or to the time elapsed since the episode.},

Based on a survey experiment with a representative sample of around 3500 Germans at the beginning of the pandemic, we study how moral appeals affect contributions with low and high opportunity costs, hand washing and social distancing, to reduce the infection externality as well as the support for governmental regulation. We find that Deontological moral suasion, appealing to individual moral duty, is effective in increasing planned social distancing and hand-washing, while a Consequentialist appeal only increases planned hand-washing. Both appeals increase support for governmental regulation. Exploring heterogeneous treatment effects reveals that younger respondents are more susceptible to Deontological appeals. Our results highlight the potential of moral appeals to induce intended private contributions to a public good or the reduction of externalities, which can help to overcome collective action problems for a range of environmental issues.},

	abstract = {Graeber’s Debt: The First 5 000 Years has generated extensive commentary in the popular press and has captured the imagination of both activists at the barricades and investment fund managers in the City of London. Everyone is captivated by his critique of the myth of primitive barter. Yet it is a puzzle that a core element of his argument—the myth of primordial debt—has been largely overlooked. This review seeks to redress this oversight and in the process to suggest that Graeber’s emphasis on violence and enslavement, while compelling, is limited by his quest for origins. Feminist anthropology taught us to set aside the question, ‘when did “it” begin’ and instead open up to other questions, beyond the limits and biases the quest for origins presupposes. One wishes Graeber had entered the wonder cabinet he constructed in this book, rather than use it to ground a teleology.},

	abstract = {The “new” accounting historians that emerged from the mid-1980s characterised their predecessors as relying heavily on a view of accounting as progressive and accounting change as evolutionary. From a social science perspective, progress is a problematic concept, as it implies not just change but also improvement, and thus seems to imply the making of a value judgement. As accounting has become an object of study less as a technical and more as a social phenomenon, consensus as to what constitutes an improvement becomes harder to secure. However, from a perspective grounded in historiography, this paper reviews the use of a concept of progress in the writing of history from the eighteenth century, and analyses its use, together with that of a concept of evolution, in “traditional” accounting history. Appealing to recent developments in the understanding of the role of narrative in history, the paper suggests that the use of narratives of accounting progress should not be ruled out on a priori grounds.},

At best, violence results in mere redistribution; being destructive, it more often results in a loss of social welfare. When organized, however, violence can be socially productive; it can be employed to defend property rights, thereby strengthening the incentives to engage in productive activity. To explore how violence can be rendered a source of welfare, the authors develop a model of a stateless society in which people's rights to the product of their labor are secure only if they possess coercive capabilities. Using case materials and formal logic, the authors then compare this outcome with that obtained when private agents reward specialists in violence for defending property rights. In doing so, we plumb the role of the state.},

In this paper we aim to open up the debate into the construction of emotion in early prehistory by proposing key stages in the emotional motivation to help others; the feeling of compassion, in human evolution.

	abstract = {The remains of 61 individuals buried in the cemetery of Jebel Sahaba (site 117) offer unique and substantial evidence to the emergence of violence in the Nile Valley at the end of the Late Pleistocene. Excavated and assessed in the 1960s, some of the original findings and interpretations are disputed. A full reanalysis of the timing, nature and extent of the violence was conducted through the microscopic characterization of the nature of each osseous lesion, and the reassessment of the archaeological data. Over 100 previously undocumented healed and unhealed lesions were identified on both new and/or previously identified victims, including several embedded lithic artefacts. Most trauma appears to be the result of projectile weapons and new analyses confirm for the first time the repetitive nature of the interpersonal acts of violence. Indeed, a quarter of the skeletons with lesions exhibit both healed and unhealed trauma. We dismiss the hypothesis that Jebel Sahaba reflects a single warfare event, with the new data supporting sporadic and recurrent episodes of inter-personal violence, probably triggered by major climatic and environmental changes. At least 13.4 ka old, Jebel Sahaba is one of the earliest sites displaying interpersonal violence in the world.},

We also reanalyze previous data to show that facial competence is a highly robust and specific predictor of political preferences.

	abstract = {Public choice theory borrows the basic assumptions of neoclassical economics about the nature of human rationality and applies them to the explanation and prediction of behavior in the political domain (Downs, 1957). An attractive, and seductive, feature of the theory is a very strong rationality assumption (maximization of subjective expected utility) that appears to permit a great deal of explanation and prediction without the painful necessity of first constructing an empirically based theory of human behavior, in particular, a theory of the nature and limits of human rationality. To an important extent, deductive reasoning from the theory's basic postulates of rationality substitutes for a great deal of costly empirical inquiry. The frequent use of public choice theory today in political science calls for an examination of the assumptions of rationality that the theory employs. This paper carries out such an examination. The analysis focuses on three issues: the nature of the rationality assumption, the orthogonality of rationality and selfishness, and the possibility of altruism. Our inquiry will lead us to the conclusion that human rationality is much more complex than it is portrayed to be in neoclassical and public choice theories, and that much less can be derived by deductive means from the (amended) assumptions of rationality than has been supposed by the exponents of those theories. An important corollary to this conclusion is that a veridical theory of public choice requires a solid foundation of empirical fact about the nature of human goals and about the processes that people use in reasoning from their actions to their values.},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose that the conventional dichotomy between exemplar-based and prototype-based models of concept learning is helpfully viewed as an instance of what is known in the statistical learning literature as the bias/variance tradeoff. The bias/variance tradeoff can be thought of as a sliding scale that modulates how closely any learning procedure adheres to its training data. At one end of the scale (high variance), models can entertain very complex hypotheses, allowing them to fit a wide variety of data very closely—but as a result can generalize poorly, a phenomenon called overfitting. At the other end of the scale (high bias), models make relatively simple and inflexible assumptions, and as a result may fit the data poorly, called underfitting. Exemplar and prototype models of category formation are at opposite ends of this scale: prototype models are highly biased, in that they assume a simple, standard conceptual form (the prototype), while exemplar models have very little bias but high variance, allowing them to fit virtually any combination of training data. We investigated human learners’ position on this spectrum by confronting them with category structures at variable levels of intrinsic complexity, ranging from simple prototype-like categories to much more complex multimodal ones. The results show that human learners adopt an intermediate point on the bias/variance continuum, inconsistent with either of the poles occupied by most conventional approaches. We present a simple model that adjusts (regularizes) the complexity of its hypotheses in order to suit the training data, which fits the experimental data better than representative exemplar and prototype models.},

	abstract = {Despite many efforts, the behavior of a crowd is not fully understood. The advent of modern communication means has made it an even more challenging problem, as crowd dynamics could be driven by both human-to-human and human-technology interactions. Here, we study the dynamics of a crowd controlled game (Twitch Plays Pokémon), in which nearly a million players participated during more than two weeks. Unlike other online games, in this event all the players controlled exactly the same character and thus it represents an exceptional example of a collective mind working to achieve a certain goal. We dissect the temporal evolution of the system dynamics along the two distinct phases that characterized the game. We find that having a fraction of players who do not follow the crowd’s average behavior is key to succeed in the game. The latter finding can be well explained by an {\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}textgreatern{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreaterth order Markov model that reproduces the observed behavior. Secondly, we analyze a phase of the game in which players were able to decide between two different modes of playing, mimicking a voting system. We show that the introduction of this system clearly polarized the community, splitting it in two. Finally, we discuss one of the peculiarities of these groups in the light of the social identity theory, which appears to describe well some of the observed dynamics.},

Third, the attempt to operationalize the Whorfian hypothesis is shown to establish a frame against which Berlin and Kay reacted, and an experimental practice they appropriated. Their programme is disclosed as a structure in which results are self-evident, when in fact they are deduced from prior commitments. Berlin and Kay's new alliance with colour science is then examined by showing how experiments cancel the life-world, how a notion of `unmediated presence' is methodologically exploited, how research techniques are effaced and data are `cleaned'. Finally, it is suggested that the thesis is built on layers of mistakes which produce misrepresentations both of colour science and of intercultural relations.},

And they believe that political participation is good for us—it empowers us, helps us get what we want, and tends to make us smarter, more virtuous, and more caring for one another. These are some of our most cherished ideas about democracy. But, Jason Brennan says, they are all wrong. In this trenchant book, Brennan argues that democracy should be judged by its results—and the results are not good enough. Just as defendants have a right to a fair trial, citizens have a right to competent government. But democracy is the rule of the ignorant and the irrational, and it all too often falls short. Furthermore, no one has a fundamental right to any share of political power, and exercising political power does most of us little good. On the contrary, a wide range of social science research shows that political participation and democratic deliberation actually tend to make people worse—more irrational, biased, and mean. Given this grim picture, Brennan argues that a new system of government—epistocracy, the rule of the knowledgeable—may be better than democracy, and that it's time to experiment and find out. A challenging critique of democracy and the first sustained defense of the rule of the knowledgeable, Against Democracy is essential reading for scholars and students of politics across the disciplines.},

	abstract = {Hypnosis has been an elusive concept for science for a long time. However, the explosive advances in neuroscience in the last few decades have provided a “bridge of understanding” between classical neurophysiological studies and psychophysiological studies. These studies have shed new light on the neural basis of the hypnotic experience. Furthermore, an ambitious new area of research is focusing on mapping the core processes of psychotherapy and the neurobiology/underlying them. Hypnosis research offers powerful techniques to isolate psychological processes in ways that allow their neural bases to be mapped. The Hypnotic Brain can serve as a way to tap neurocognitive questions and our cognitive assays can in turn shed new light on the neural bases of hypnosis. This cross-talk should enhance research and clinical applications. An increasing body of evidence provides insight in the neural mechanisms of the Meditative Brain. Discrete meditative styles are likely to target different neurodynamic patterns. Recent findings emphasize increased attentional resources activating the attentional and salience networks with coherent perception. Cognitive and emotional equanimity gives rise to an eudaimonic state, made of calm, resilience and stability, readiness to express compassion and empathy, a main goal of Buddhist practices. Structural changes in gray matter of key areas of the brain involved in learning processes suggest that these skills can be learned through practice. Hypnosis and Meditation represent two important, historical and influential landmarks of Western and Eastern civilization and culture respectively. Neuroscience has beginning to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of both Hypnotic and Meditative Brain, outlining similarities but also differences between the two states and processes. It is important not to view either the Eastern or the Western system as superior to the other. Cross-fertilization of the ancient Eastern meditation techniques presented with Western modern clinical hypnosis will hopefully result in each enriching the other.},

While religious involvement offers clear benefits to many, in this paper we explore whether it may also be detrimental to some. Specifically, we examine in detail the relation between religious involvement and subjective well-being. We first replicate prior findings showing a positive relation between religiosity and subjective well-being. However, our results also suggest that this relation may be more complex than previously thought. While fervent believers benefit from their involvement, those with weaker beliefs are actually less happy than those who do not ascribe to any religion—atheists and agnostics. These results may help explain why—in spite of the well-documented benefits of religion—an increasing number of people are abandoning their faith. As commitment wanes, religious involvement may become detrimental to well-being, and individuals may be better off seeking new affiliations.},

The function Si is called the ith units supply function. The market M is said to have an equilibrium if there exists a price vector pe and commodity bundles x1,..., xm such that xi ∈ Si(pe) and Σ xi ≧ 0, this last condition being the requirement that the amount of Gj supplied be at least equal to the amount consumed.

The theory of consumer choice, the theory of the firm, industrial organization, and welfare theorems all require the assumption that agents act in accordance with the scheme of individualistic rational optimization. In this context, our contribution is threefold. First, we delimit the notion of homo economicus according to five characteristics or dimensions. Second, we critically review this anthropological scheme from five distinct approaches, namely, behavioral economics, institutional economics, political economy, economic anthropology, and ecological economics. Third, we conclude that the scheme of homo economicus is clearly inadequate and deficient. However, despite its inadequacies, it remains one of the fundamental pillars of the neoclassical paradigm in economics, which allows us to discuss why we have not yet overcome this paradigm.},

Discussing various possible economic explanations for the difference, they cover different levels of pre-tax income, openness, and social mobility; they survey politico-historical differences such as the varying physical size of nations, their electoral and legal systems, and the character of their political parties, as well as their experiences of war; and they examine sociological explanations, which include different attitudes to the poor and notions of social responsibility. Most importantly, they address attitudes to race, calculating that attitudes to race explain half the observed difference in levels of public redistribution of income.

	abstract = {This article examines the importance of one possible explanation for the failure of African countries to step onto the bottom rung of the manufacturing sophistication ladder, that is to produce apparel. Used‐clothing donations to thrift shops and other organisations in industrialised countries typically end up being sold to consumers in Africa. Since used clothing is initially provided as a donation, it shares characteristics with food aid, which always assists consumers, but at times harms African food producers. Used‐clothing imports are found to have a negative impact on apparel production in Africa, explaining roughly 40\% of the decline in production and 50\% of the decline in employment over the period 1981–2000.},

	abstract = {Spaced retrieval practice consists of repetitions of the same retrieval event distributed through time. This learning strategy combines two “desirable difficulties”: retrieval practice and spacing effects. We carried out meta-analyses on 29 studies investigating the benefit of spacing out retrieval practice episodes on final retention. The total dataset was divided into two subsets to investigate two main questions: (1) Does spaced retrieval practice induce better memory retention than massed retrieval practice? (subset 1); (2) Is the expanding spacing schedule superior to the uniform spacing schedule when learning with retrieval practice? (subset 2). Using meta-regression with robust variance estimation, 39 effect sizes were aggregated in subset 1 and 54 in subset 2. Results from subset 1 indicated a strong benefit of spaced retrieval practice in comparison with massed retrieval practice (g = 0.74). Results from subset 2 indicated no significant difference between expanding and uniform spacing schedules of retrieval practice (g = 0.034). Moderator analyses on this subset showed that the number of exposures of an item during retrieval practice explains inconsistencies between studies: the more learners are tested, the more beneficial the expanding schedule is compared with the uniform one. Overall, these results support the advantage of spacing out the retrieval practice episodes on the same content, but do not support the widely held belief that inter-retrieval intervals should be progressively increased until a retention test.},

He then asks the simple yet provocative questions: Why all the cheating? Why now?   Callahan pins the blame on today’s dog-eat-dog economic climate. An unfettered market and unprecedented economic inequality have corroded our values and threaten the level playing field so central to American democracy itself. Through revealing interviews and extensive data analysis, Callahan takes readers on a revealing tour of cheating in America and offers a powerful argument for why it matters.},

The article describes the scale-development strategy employed to overcome the problems associated with measuring science curiosity. It also reports data, observational and experimental, showing that science curiosity promotes open-minded engagement with information that is contrary to individuals’ political predispositions. We conclude by identifying a series of concrete research questions posed by these results.},

Distinguishing these factors is essential for estimating sensitivity to multiple climatic forcings and the amplitude of the unforced variability. Here we present 2,000-year-long global mean temperature reconstructions using seven different statistical methods that draw from a global collection of temperature-sensitive paleoclimate records. Our reconstructions display synchronous multi-decadal temperature fluctuations, which are coherent with one another and with fully forced CMIP5 millennial model simulations across the Common Era. The most significant attribution of pre-industrial (1300-1800 CE) variability at multi-decadal timescales is to volcanic aerosol forcing. Reconstructions and simulations qualitatively agree on the amplitude of the unforced global mean multi-decadal temperature variability, thereby increasing confidence in future projections of climate change on these timescales. The largest warming trends at timescales of 20 years and longer occur during the second half of the 20th century, highlighting the unusual character of the warming in recent decades.},

This book examines the underlying causes. It provides analyses of a range of case studies from Brazil, Cameroon, China, Danube River Basin, India, Mexico, Pakistan, Philippines, Tanzania and Vietnam, and integrates them into a new and interdisciplinary framework for understanding what is happening. From these results, the editors are able to derive policy conclusions and recommendations for operational and institutional approaches to address the root causes and reverse the current trends.

Kurzweil predicts that a core feature of the singularity will be the merging of biological and machine intelligence, such that the majority of “human” intelligence will become non-biological, and the merging of virtual and physical reality.

In this context, I identify two events that can quantitatively explain the increase in the correlation: (i) a sharp drop in the volatility of non-technology shocks in the mid-1980s, and (ii) a decline in the response of productivity to non-technology shocks, which from procyclical became acyclical in the last 25 years.},

	abstract = {The present paper reviews the reactions and the path of acceptance of the theory known as “peak oil”. The theory was proposed for the first time by M.K. Hubbert in the 1950s as a way to describe the production pattern of crude oil. According to Hubbert, the production curve is “bell shaped” and approximately symmetric. Hubbert's theory was verified with good approximation for the case of oil production in the United States that peaked in 1971, and is now being applied to the worldwide oil production. It is generally believed that the global peak of oil production (“peak oil”) will take place during the first decade of the 21st century, and some analysts believe that it has already occurred in 2005 or 2006. The theory and its consequences have unpleasant social and economical implications. The present paper is not aimed at assessing the peak date but offers a discussion on the factors that affect the acceptance and the diffusion of the concept of “peak oil” with experts and with the general public. The discussion is based on a subdivision of “four stages of acceptance”, loosely patterned after a sentence by Thomas Huxley.},

These markedly differing accounts are considered in relation to limitations imposed by preparative and microscopical methods, and are discussed briefly as representing a post-Darwinian, reductionist view, on the one hand, opposed to a holistic view of mankind as a special part of creation, on the other. The widely misunderstood relationship of the neuron doctrine to the cell theory is discussed, as is the degree to which the neuron doctrine is still strictly applicable to an analysis of nervous systems. Current research represents a ‘post-neuronist’ era.

@incollection{thagard_cognitive_2013,
	edition = {2},
	title = {Cognitive science},
	isbn = {978-0-203-74485-7},
	shorttitle = {(2013) {Cognitive} science},
	abstract = {The primary goal of cognitive science is to explain the operations of the human mind, 
but what is an explanation? In general philosophy of science, explanations have often 
been discussed as deductions from general laws or, sometimes, as schematic patterns 
that unify diverse phenomena. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that explanations in cognitive science employ representations of mechanisms that provide 
causal accounts of such mental phenomena as perception, memory, problem-solving, 
and learning. Theories are sets of hypotheses about the constituents of the explanatory 
mechanisms. Numerous philosophers of science have defended the mechanistic 
account of explanations in various elds (see Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2005). I now 
describe how explanations of human thinking involve mechanisms. 
 Cognitive science began in the mid-1950s when psychologists, linguists, and 
researchers in the nascent enterprise of articial intelligence realized that ideas fromthe emerging eld of computer science could be used to explain how minds work. 
The rst operational computational model of mind was Newell, Shaw, and Simon’s 
logic theorist, which simulated how people do proofs in deductive logic. That model 
and many later ones worked with what became the fundamental analogy of cognitive 
science: just as computer programs run by applying algorithms to data structures, so the 
human mind works by applying computational procedures to mental representations. 
 Many competing proposals have been made about what are the most important 
mental representations in human thinking, ranging from rules to concepts to images 
to analogies to neural networks. And for each kind of mental representation there are 
different kinds of computational procedure; for example, rules are IF-THEN structures 
that work by matching the IF part and then applying the THEN part. But all of those 
approaches assume that thinking is like computation, in that it applies algorithmic 
procedures to structured representations.
 Explanations that employ computational ideas are clearly mechanistic. A mechanism 
is a system of objects related to one another in various ways including part-whole and 
spatial contiguity, such that the properties of the parts and the relations between 
them produce regular changes in the system. For example, a bicycle is a mechanism 
consisting of parts (e.g., the frame, wheels, and pedals) that are related to one another 
so that the bicycle moves when force is applied to the pedals. Similarly, according to 
the computational hypothesis of cognitive science, the mind is a mechanism whose 
parts are mental representations of various sorts, organized such that there are computational procedures which operate on them to produce new representations. No one 
would disagree that computers are mechanisms built out of hardware and software 
that enable them to perform complex tasks, and the computer-mind analogy made 
it possible for the rst time to see how highly complex thinking could be performed 
mechanically. Prior to the emergence of cognitive science in the 1950s, many mental 
mechanisms had been proposed, ranging from clockwork to association of ideas to 
telephone switchboards to stimulus-response connections. But only with the development of advanced hardware and software did it become possible to understand how 
the most sophisticated kinds of human problem-solving, learning, and language could 
operate mechanistically. 
 Of course, not everyone in the constituent elds of cognitive science has been 
attracted to the computational approach to explaining mental phenomena. In philosophy 
there are still dualists who think that consciousness is not explicable in terms of physical 
mechanisms, but their arguments consist of thought-experiments that merely serve to 
reinforce their own prejudices (see Churchland 2002 for an accessible review). More 
usefully, a host of cognitive scientists have pointed out that we should not explain 
thinking solely in terms of the internal operations of the mind, but should take into 
account also ways in which humans have bodies that enable them to interact causally 
with the world. But robots can also have bodies that enable them to interact with the 
world and form meaningful representations of it, so the claims that cognition is embodied 
and situated are extensions to the computational view of mind, not replacements for it. 
 If cognitive explanations consist of showing how mental mechanisms can produce 
psychological phenomena, then psychological theories are representations of suchmechanisms. Representations of mechanisms can be verbal, as when I described a 
bicycle in terms of its parts and their relations. But they can also be visual, as, for 
example, when a bicycle is portrayed using a diagram or, even better, using a movie 
that shows it in operation. Similarly, psychological theories are usually presented via 
a combination of verbal and visual representations. For example, theories of concepts 
are often presented by a combination of verbal descriptions, mathematical equations 
that describe such procedures as spreading activation, and diagrams that portray how 
different concepts are related to each other. Similarly, theories about how neural 
networks produce psychological phenomena are presented using a combination of 
verbal, mathematical, and visual representations. These multimodal representations 
of theories may seem puzzling from the traditional view in philosophy of science that 
theories are universal statements in a formal language, but they make complete sense 
if explanation is understood not as deduction in a formal system but as application 
of mechanisms. From that perspective, the primary purpose of theories is to depict 
mechanisms, and visual representations are often more effective means of representing the part-whole and spatial relations of objects in a mechanism than purely 
verbal representations. Later in this essay I argue that most scientic theories, not just 
cognitive ones, can be understood as representations of mechanisms. 
 Thus far, I have been discussing computational mechanisms of the sort that 
dominated cognitive theorizing in the second half of the twentieth century. But rapid 
increases in knowledge about how brains work have led increasingly to psychological 
explanations that are based on neural mechanisms rather than abstract computational ones. In the 1980s, there was a revival of interest in computational models that 
employ articial neural networks, but until recently these were so articial that they 
are more aptly classied as abstract computational models rather than as neurological 
ones. What were called “connectionist” or “parallel distributed processing” models are 
giving way to more biologically realistic ones. 
 Neurocognitive theories are now being proposed that have three key properties 
that differentiate them from their much simpler predecessors. First, their main components are artificial neurons that are much more biologically realistic than connectionist 
neurons, which typically possess an activation value that represents their rate of 
ring. The new wave of neurocognitive models takes into account that neurons not 
only have ring rates – how often they re in a given stretch of time – but also ring 
patterns. Two neurons may each re twenty times a second, but have very different 
patterns when they are ring and when they are resting, and there are psychological 
and computational reasons to believe that such patterns are important. Second, 
whereas connectionist models typically used small numbers (often less than 100) 
of articial neurons to model psychological phenomena, more biologically realistic 
neurocognitive models usually have thousands of less articial neurons interacting with 
each other. Such models are still puny compared to the billions of neurons operating 
in the brain, but they have greater capacity to capture the representational and 
computational power of brains. Third, and probably most importantly, the new wave 
of neurocognitive models takes brain anatomy seriously, organizing groups of articial 
neurons in correspondence to actual brain areas. The brain is not just one big neuralnetwork, but is highly organized into functional areas that accomplish particular tasks, 
such as vision, motor control, language, and reasoning. The different areas are highly 
interconnected, so that there are not isolated modules operating independently, but 
the interconnections within a particular brain area are much denser than the connections with other brain areas. Accordingly, neurocognitive models increasingly have 
dedicated groups of neurons representing particular brain areas, such as parts of the 
prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala. For examples of neurocognitive models that use more biologically realistic neurons and neural organization, see 
Eliasmith and Anderson (2003).
 It should be evident that the more biologically realistic neurocognitive models are 
still mechanistic and computational. They are mechanistic in that they consist of 
objects – neurons – organized via part-whole and spatial relations. Neurons are parts 
of neuronal groups that are parts of brain areas such as the prefrontal cortex. Neurons 
are related to one another not just by spatial contiguity, but more importantly by 
axons and dendrites that connect them physically via synapses, making them capable 
of exciting or inhibiting the ring of other neurons. Hence changes in the ring 
patterns of individual neurons lead to changes in the activity of entire brain areas 
and, ultimately, to changes in behavior. Thus the complexes of neurons postulated 
by neurocognitive models are clearly mechanisms and theories of neural functioning 
are well understood as representations of mechanisms. Perusal of textbooks in neuroscience and cognitive psychology will conrm that such representations are usually 
multimodal, involving a combination of verbal description, mathematical equations 
that describe neural behavior, and diagrams that indicate spatial and temporal 
relations. 
 But are biologically realistic models still computational? The cognitive models 
discussed earlier are “computational” in a dual sense, in that they not only use 
computers to do the complex calculations required for modeling, but also postulate 
that minds are actually performing a kind of computation. Contrast computer models 
in elds such as physics, chemistry, and weather-forecasting, where no one thinks that 
the systems being modeled are actually doing computations. Neurocognitive models 
are also computational in the dual sense, in that it is reasonable to postulate that 
brains are actually computing by encoding, decoding, and transforming information. 
Hence they do not involve rejection of the fundamental analogy of cognitive science 
that thinking is computing, only a substantial enrichment of it in terms of more 
biologically realistic neural processes. 
 Computational and neural mechanisms are not the only ones relevant to explaining 
human thinking. Humans are social animals, and much thinking takes place in 
interaction with other people. Decision-making, for example, is often not just one 
person deciding alone, but groups of people interacting to work things out together. 
Social groups can also be understood as mechanisms, in which the parts are people 
and sub-groups and the relations are interpersonal ones such as communication. 
As indicated by the inclusion of anthropology as one of the disciplines of cognitive 
science, the eld is open to the inclusion of the social dimension of thinking, so that 
attention to social mechanisms is a natural part of cognitive science.},

	abstract = {Our knowledge of the brain has evolved over millennia in philosophical, experimental and theoretical phases. We suggest that the next phase is simulation neuroscience. The main drivers of simulation neuroscience are big data generated at multiple levels of brain organization and the need to integrate these data to trace the causal chain of interactions within and across all these levels. Simulation neuroscience is currently the only methodology for systematically approaching the multiscale brain. In this review, we attempt to reconstruct the deep historical paths leading to simulation neuroscience, from the first observations of the nerve cell to modern efforts to digitally reconstruct and simulate the brain. Neuroscience began with the identification of the neuron as the fundamental unit of brain structure and function and has evolved towards understanding the role of each cell type in the brain, how brain cells are connected to each other, and how the seemingly infinite networks they form give rise to the vast diversity of brain functions. Neuronal mapping is evolving from subjective descriptions of cell types towards objective classes, subclasses and types. Connectivity mapping is evolving from loose topographic maps between brain regions towards dense anatomical and physiological maps of connections between individual genetically distinct neurons. Functional mapping is evolving from psychological and behavioral stereotypes towards a map of behaviors emerging from structural and functional connectomes. We show how industrialization of neuroscience and the resulting large disconnected datasets are generating demand for integrative neuroscience, how the scale of neuronal and connectivity maps is driving digital atlasing and digital reconstruction to piece together the multiple levels of brain organization, and how the complexity of the interactions between molecules, neurons, microcircuits and brain regions is driving brain simulation to understand the interactions in the multiscale brain.},

Our systems have a fixed structure, invariant in time, corresponding to an unchanging number of “neurons”. If allowed exponential time for computation, they turn out to have unbounded power. However, under polynomial-time constraints there are limits on their capabilities, though being more powerful than Turing machines. (A similar but more restricted model was shown to be polynomial-time equivalent to classical digital computation in the previous work (Siegelmann and Sontag, 1992).) Moreover, there is a precise correspondence between nets and standard nonuniform circuits with equivalent resources, and as a consequence one has lower bound constraints on what they can compute. This relationship is perhaps surprising since our analog devices do not change in any manner with input size. We note that these networks are not likely to solve polynomially NP-hard problems, as the equality “p=np” in our model implies the almost complete collapse of the standard polynomial hierarchy. In contrast to classical computational models, the models studied here exhibit at least some robustness with respect to noise and implementation errors.},

Dynamical properties of learning curves are then studied based on an old paper by the author where the stochastic descent method was proposed for general multilayer networks. The paper is concluded with a short section offering some historical remarks.},

Deep neural networks simulate the human visual system and achieve human equivalent accuracy in image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

Video game images were used as the inputs. The proposed DPCANet was used to initialize the parameters of the convolution kernel and capture the image features automatically. It performs as a deep neural network and requires less computational complexity than traditional convolution neural networks. A reinforcement Q-learning method was used to implement a strategy for playing the video game. Both Flappy Bird and Atari Breakout games were implemented to verify the proposed method in this study. Experimental results showed that the scores of our proposed RQDNN were better than those of human players and other methods. In addition, the training time of the proposed RQDNN was also far less than other methods.},

However, building a high-quality DL system for a specific task highly relies on human expertise, hindering its wide application. Meanwhile, automated machine learning (AutoML) is a promising solution for building a DL system without human assistance and is being extensively studied. This paper presents a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in AutoML. According to the DL pipeline, we introduce AutoML methods – covering data preparation, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and neural architecture search (NAS) – with a particular focus on NAS, as it is currently a hot sub-topic of AutoML. We summarize the representative NAS algorithms’ performance on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and further discuss the following subjects of NAS methods: one/two-stage NAS, one-shot NAS, joint hyperparameter and architecture optimization, and resource-aware NAS. Finally, we discuss some open problems related to the existing AutoML methods for future research.},

	abstract = {Much of recent machine learning has focused on deep learning, in which neural network weights are trained through variants of stochastic gradient descent. An alternative approach comes from the field of neuroevolution, which harnesses evolutionary algorithms to optimize neural networks, inspired by the fact that natural brains themselves are the products of an evolutionary process. Neuroevolution enables important capabilities that are typically unavailable to gradient-based approaches, including learning neural network building blocks (for example activation functions), hyperparameters, architectures and even the algorithms for learning themselves. Neuroevolution also differs from deep learning (and deep reinforcement learning) by maintaining a population of solutions during search, enabling extreme exploration and massive parallelization. Finally, because neuroevolution research has (until recently) developed largely in isolation from gradient-based neural network research, it has developed many unique and effective techniques that should be effective in other machine learning areas too. This Review looks at several key aspects of modern neuroevolution, including large-scale computing, the benefits of novelty and diversity, the power of indirect encoding, and the field’s contributions to meta-learning and architecture search. Our hope is to inspire renewed interest in the field as it meets the potential of the increasing computation available today, to highlight how many of its ideas can provide an exciting resource for inspiration and hybridization to the deep learning, deep reinforcement learning and machine learning communities, and to explain how neuroevolution could prove to be a critical tool in the long-term pursuit of artificial general intelligence.},

With the recent emphasis on biomimicry and bioinspiration, such collaborations are bound to increase in number and may be central to many future research programs. Far too often, however, there is no resonance between the philosophies that guide each research program. Engineers tend to look at biological phenomena with a designer’s eye, something against which biologists are explicitly cautioned. On the other hand, biologists may often prefer a descriptive route over a mechanistic one. How can we make such collaborations resonate better from an intellectual perspective? In this essay, I describe a short historical account of biomimicry and bioinspiration, and offer suggestions for better collaborations between engineers and biologists, with examples of cases in which fruitful approaches have been adopted.},

Methods We tested mice for empathy-like behaviors toward conspecifics who were distressed. We investigated behavioral changes in cage-mate or stranger mice. Results When the conspecific mice were in a painful state, subject mice showed preferential approach behavior toward them, presumably recognizing the state. Both visual information and olfactory information are indispensable for this empathic behavior. Conclusions These results suggest that the mouse recognizes the emotional state of the conspecific and engages in social interaction. The results of this study are useful for the elucidation of the causal mechanisms involved in neuropsychiatric disorders and may contribute in the development of novel treatment targets.},

	abstract = {Humans have a sense of fairness, i.e. an interest in the ideal of equity. This sense allows them to compare their own efforts and subsequent outcomes with those of others, and thus to evaluate and react to inequity. The question is whether our closest living relatives, the non-human primates, show the behavioural characteristics that might qualify as necessary components to a sense of fairness, such as inequity aversion. In this article, we review the five different experimental approaches to studying behaviours related to fairness in non-human primates, including their underlying logic and main findings that represent the current state of research in this field. In the critical condition of all these studies, a subject and a conspecific partner have either to invest different efforts or receive different outcomes while observing each other. The main question is whether—and how—subjects react to unequal situations that humans would perceive as ‘unfair’. Taken together, the results from all five approaches provide only weak evidence for a sense of fairness in non-human primates. Although apes and monkeys are attentive to what the partner is getting, they do not seem to be able or motivated to compare their own efforts and outcomes with those of others at a human level. Even though the debate is still on-going, we believe that a full sense of fairness is not essential for cooperation. Obviously, apes and monkeys are capable of solving problems cooperatively, without a strong, humanlike sense of fairness. They are mainly interested in maximizing their own benefit, regardless of what others may receive. It is thus possible that a sense of fairness only exists rudimentarily in non-human primates.},

At the same time, human life expectancy has increased all over the globe at unprecedented rates. The present work represents an effort to sketch out how water purity and life expectancy have entangled, thus influencing one another. Water properties and characteristics have directly affected life quality and longevity. The dramatic increase in life expectancy has been, indisputably, affected by the improvement in water quality, but also in other concomitant factors, varying temporally and spatially in different parts of the world throughout the centuries. Water technologies and engineering have an unequivocal role on life expectancy. In some cases, they appear to have taken place earlier than the progress of modern medicine. Among these, improved sanitation, personal hygiene, progress in medicine, and better standards of economic living have played the greatest roles.},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

Despite their success, most available models have either been trained on English data or on the concatenation of data in multiple languages. This makes practical use of such models --in all languages except English-- very limited. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of training monolingual Transformer-based language models for other languages, taking French as an example and evaluating our language models on part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition and natural language inference tasks. We show that the use of web crawled data is preferable to the use of Wikipedia data. More surprisingly, we show that a relatively small web crawled dataset (4GB) leads to results that are as good as those obtained using larger datasets (130+GB). Our best performing model CamemBERT reaches or improves the state of the art in all four downstream tasks.},

	abstract = {Although the concept of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) is quite popular among English speaking physicians, it still needs to be adopted by an overwhelming majority of health care professionals in countries where English is not familiar. Thus, this concept can be translated in many different, and potentially misleading, ways. This is regrettable because the concept is, at least potentially, a very useful one. As an illustration, I have compiled some of the French translations of EBM that are currently in use in French speaking countries, and indicated briefly how most of these translations (except for one) are bound to be misleading. Many of these misleading translations currently in use strongly suggest that it is time for an international standardisation of the translations of EBM in different languages.

Trekonomics, the premier book in financial journalist Felix Salmon's imprint PiperText, approaches scarcity economics by coming at it backwards — through thinking about a universe where scarcity does not exist. Delving deep into the details and intricacies of 24th century society, Trekonomics explores post-scarcity and whether we, as humans, are equipped for it.

Since then, many analytic quasiperiodic solutions have been sought to higher order1–10.1 have recently constructed an extensive analytic system of averaged differential equations containing the secular evolution of the orbits of the eight main planets, accurate to second order in the planetary masses and to fifth order in eccentricity and inclination, and including corrections from general relativity and the Moon8–10. Here I describe the results of a numerical integration of this system, extending backwards over 200 million years. The solution is chaotic, with a maximum Lyapunov exponent that reaches the surprisingly large value of ∼ 1/5 Myr–1. The motion of the Solar System is thus shown to be chaotic, not quasiperiodic. In particular, predictability of the orbits of the inner planets, including the Earth, is lost within a few tens of millions of years. This does not mean that after such a short timespan we will see catastrophic events such as a crossing of the orbits of Venus and Earth; but the traditional tools of quantitative celestial mechanics (numerical integrations or analytical theories), which aim at unique solutions from given initial conditions, will fail to predict such events. The problem of the stability of the Solar System will have to be set up again, and the qualitative methods initiated by Poincare definitely need to replace quantitative methods in this analysis.},

In the experiments described here, control programs for mobile agents (simulated vehicles) are evolved based on their skill at the game of tag. A player's fitness is determined by how well it performs when placed in competition with several opponents chosen randomly from the coevolving population of players. In the beginning, the quality of play is very poor. Then slightly better strategies begin to exploit the weaknesses of others. Through evolution, guided by competitive fitness, increasingly better strategies emerge over time. 1. Introduction Many of us remember playing the game of tag as children. Tag is played by two or more, one of whom is designated as it. The it player chases the others, who all try to escape. Tag is a simple contest of pursuit and evasion. These activities are common in the natural world, most predatorprey interactions involve pursuit and evasion. Tag also includes an aspect of role-reversal, b...},
